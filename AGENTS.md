# AGENTS.md — GPT-5.6: Sol / Action RPG DEMO

Three.js browser action RPG (hunting · farming · skills · world tiers). **No CDN** — Three uses `vendor/` local only.

Detailed guides are in **`docs/`** — hub: [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md). Short edits: [docs/quick-edit-recipes.md](./docs/quick-edit-recipes.md). Large features: [docs/extension-playbooks.md](./docs/extension-playbooks.md).  
**Hero classes / multi-class:** [docs/agent/README.md](./docs/agent/README.md) (add class playbook, wizard reference, facing, validation).

## Essentials

1. **Data location** — balance/catalog `js/data/content.js` · skill math `js/data/skillCombat.js` · FX themes `js/data/fxThemes.js` · tuning `js/config.js` · hit detection `js/systems/CombatSystem.js` · VFX recipes `js/graphics/Effects.js`
2. **Camera** — `Game.shake` / `Game.hitStop` are no-ops. Do not re-enable without request.
3. **Scope** — only what was requested. No unrelated refactor, full reformat, or `vendor/` edits.
4. **Validation** — if you touch content/paths, run `node tests/integrity.mjs`.
5. **Run** — `file://` forbidden. `node server.mjs` → `http://127.0.0.1:8777`.

## Common basics (save tokens)

- **Read docs first, full-tree search later** — from the table below, read only 1–2 `docs/*.md`, then edit.
- **Layers** — if data suffices, only content/config. Hit detection is systems/entities. Presentation is Effects. HUD is UI + `index.html` id sync.
- **Hit ≠ mesh** — blade length (`WEAPON_*`) and hit `range` are separate. Often both must be aligned.
- **Frozen objects** — edit `Object.freeze` tables by changing fields / adding entries (keep structure).
- **Save** — do not change `saveKey`/`saveVersion` casually. On schema add, merge load defaults.
- **Git finalization** — never automatically commit or push after completing work. Commit or push only when the user explicitly asks. When committing for deploy, include **all** game assets (hero/monster/prop GLBs, etc.); this project ships to a personal server and does not exclude large models from git or deploy.
- **Deploy** — do not re-add Cloudflare-style asset size exclusions for `assets/models/hero/*.glb` (see `.assetsignore`).
- **Documentation language** — every file under `docs/` must be written in English.
- **UI language** — keep all player-facing UI strings, notifications, and HUD copy in **English**. Do not add Korean (or other non-English) player-facing text.
- **Debug** — `window.__SOL_ARPG_DEMO__`, F3 HUD. Cheats should be guarded by `?debug=1`.
